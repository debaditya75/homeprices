 The homeprices app is based on data captured from the site 
 http://www.calvin.edu/~stob/data/singlefamilyhomeprices.csv

This simple application by default displays the mean home price(in thousands e.g. 150 actually represents 150,000) for the years 2004, 2005 and 2006 for the state of New York. Along with the data table displaying the mean home prices, there is a plot (done in ggplot) for the average home prices across few cities in New York. These are trend lines that show how home prices have increased or decreased in each city. 

Select new value from dropdown: When the user selects a new state name, both the data table with the average home prices by Year and the plots are refresh based on the users data.If you are reading this help text, start with New York and then select other states like California or Texas.
